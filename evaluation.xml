FastGTD MCP Server Evaluation Questions
Purpose: Test LLM's ability to effectively use FastGTD MCP tools
Requirements:
  - Each question must be independent (doesn't depend on others)
  - Read-only operations only (non-destructive)
  - Complex (requires multiple tool calls)
  - Realistic (based on real GTD use cases)
  - Verifiable (single clear answer)
  - Stable (answer won't change over time)
